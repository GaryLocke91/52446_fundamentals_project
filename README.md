This Jupyter Notebook concerns the ```powerproduction``` data set, upon which simple linear regression is performed. Simple linear regression is also compared to other types of regression on this data set. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.

### Executing the Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook can be installed either from the [main website](https://jupyter.org/) or as part of the [Anaconda Open Source Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Jupyter is a Python package designed to make it easier to interact with Python.

1. Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, download the notebook to a folder on your computer.

2. Open the command line and browse to the folder the notebook was downloaded to using the ```cd``` command to change directory.

3. Type ```jupyter notebook``` and press ENTER.

4. It automatically opens a tab in your default browser.

5. Click on *52446_fundamentals_project.ipynb* to open the notebook.

To run a code cell in the notebook, click onto the cell, hold down the CTRL key and press ENTER.
